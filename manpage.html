<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">pdfpc is a
GTK-based presentation viewer for GNU/Linux which uses
Keynote-like multi-monitor output to provide meta
information to the speaker during the presentation. It is
able to show a normal presentation window on one screen
while showing a more sophisticated overview on the other
one, providing information like a picture of the next slide,
as well as the time left in the presentation. pdfpc
processes PDF documents, which can be created using nearly
all modern presentation software.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">To run pdfpc,
simply type</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">pdfpc
file.pdf</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">By default the
presenter view appears in the primary monitor and the
presentation view in the second monitor (provided you have
two monitors). If you want to switch displays, start with
the &minus;s option (see below).</p>

<h2>FEATURES
<a name="FEATURES"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Caching /
Pre-rendering</b> <br>
To allow fast changes between the different slides of the
presentation the PDF pages are pre-rendered to memory. The
progress bar on the bottom of the presenter screen indicates
how many percent of the slides have been pre-rendered
already. During the initial rendering phase this will slow
down slide changes, as most CPU power is used for the
rendering process in the background. After the cache is
fully primed however the changing of slides should be much
faster, as with normal PDF viewers.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As the
pre-rendering takes a lot of memory it can be disabled using
the &minus;&minus;disable&minus;cache switch at the cost of
speed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Cache
compression</b> <br>
The pre-rendered and cached slides can be compressed in
memory to save up some memory. Without compression a set of
about 100 PDF pages can easily grow up to about 1.5 GB size.
Netbooks with only 1 GB of memory would swap themselves to
death if pre-rendering is enabled in such a situation. The
compression is enabled by default as it does not harm
rendering speed in a noticeable way on most systems. It does
however slow down pre-rendering by about a factor of two. If
you have got enough memory and want to ensure the fastest
possible pre-rendering you can disable slide compression by
using the &minus;z switch. But be warned using the
uncompressed pre-rendering storage will use about 30 times
the memory the new compressed storage utilizes (e.g. 50 MB
will become about 1.5 GB).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Timer</b>
<br>
If a duration is given (&minus;d option), the timer will
show a countdown with the given parameters. If no duration
is specified (or if a value of 0 is given to the &minus;d
option), the timer will show how much time has been spent.
The duration is stored automatically, so you do not need to
repeat it for every invocation.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The timer is
started if you are navigating away from the first page for
the first time. This feature is quite useful as you may want
to show the title page of your presentation while people are
still entering the room and the presentation has not really
begun yet. If you want to start over you can use the 'r' key
which will make the presenter reset the timer.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">If a duration
is given, at the moment the timer reaches the defined
last-minutes value it will change color to indicate your
talk is nearing its end. As soon as the timer reaches the
zero mark (00:00:00) it will turn red and count further down
showing a negative time, to provide information on how many
minutes you are overtime.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Notes</b>
<br>
Textual notes can be displayed for each slide. While in the
presentation, pressing 'n' will allow you to take notes for
the screen. To go out of editing mode, press the Escape key.
Note that while editing a note the keybindings stop working,
i.e. you are not able to change slides.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The notes are
stored in the given file in a plain text format, easy to
edit also from outside the program. See the section about
the pdfpc format below.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Overview
mode</b> <br>
Pressing tab you can enter the overview mode, where
miniatures for the slides are shown. You can select one
slide to jump to with the mouse or with the arrow keys. You
can also define overlays and the end slide (see next
sections) in this mode.</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Overlays</b>
<br>
Many slide preparation systems allow for overlays, i.e. sets
of slides that are logically grouped together as a single,
changing slide. Examples include enumerations where the
single items are displayed one after another or rough
&quot;animations&quot;, where parts of a picture change from
slide to slide. Pdfpc includes facilities for dealing with
such overlays.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In this
description, we will differentiate between slides (i.e.
pages in the PDF document) and &quot;user slides&quot;, that
are the logical slides. The standard forward movement
command (page down, enter, etc.) moves through one slide at
a time, as expected. That means that every step in the
overlay is traversed. The backward movement command works
differently depending if the current and previous slides are
part of an overlay:</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">&bull;</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="86%">


<p style="margin-top: 1em">If the current slide is part of
an overlay we just jump to the previous slide. That means
that we are in the middle of an overlay we can jump forward
and backward through the single steps of it</p></td></tr>
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="1%">


<p>&bull;</p></td>
<td width="2%"></td>
<td width="86%">


<p>If the current slide is not part of an overlay (or if it
is the first one), but the previous slides are, we jump to
the previous user slide. This means that when going back in
the presentation you do not have to go through every step of
the overlay, pdfpc just shows the first slide of the each
overlay. As you normally only go back in a presentation when
looking for a concrete slide, this is more convenient.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The up and down
cursor keys work on a user slide basis. You can use them to
skip the rest of an overlay or to jump to the previous user
slide, ignoring the state of the current slide.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">When going
through an overlay, two additional previews may be activated
in the presenter view, just below the main view, showing the
next and the previous slide in an overlay.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Pdfpc tries to
find these overlays automatically by looking into the page
labels in the PDF file. For LaTeX this works correctly at
least with the beamer class and also modifying the page
numbers manually (compiling with pdflatex). If your
preferred slide-producing method does not work correctly
with this detection, you can supply this information using
the 'o' key for each slide that is part of an overlay
(except the first one!). The page numbering is also adapted.
This information is automatically stored.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>End
slide</b> <br>
Some people like to have some additional, backup slides
after the last slide in the actual presentation. Things like
bibliographic references or slides referring to specialized
questions are typical examples. Pdfpc lets you define which
is the last slide in the actual presentation via the 'e'
key. This just changes the progress display in the presenter
screen, as to have a better overview of how many slides are
left.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Movies</b>
<br>
Pdfpc can play back movies included in the PDF file. Movies
may be started and stopped by clicking within their area.
For the presenter, a progress bar is drawn along the bottom
of the movie. This expands when the mouse hovers over it,
allowing one to seek by clicking or dragging within the
progress bar. Switching slides automatically stops playback,
and movies will be reset after leaving and returning to a
slide.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Movies may be
included in PDF files as &quot;screen annotations&quot;.
pdfpc does not yet support options that modify the playback
of these movies. In LaTeX, such movies may be added to a
presentation with the &quot;movie15&quot; or
&quot;multimedia&quot; package. Note that the poster,
autoplay, and repeat options are not yet supported. (Also,
run ps2pdf with the &minus;dNOSAFER flag.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As a perhaps
simpler option, pdfpc will play back movies linked from a
hyperlink of type &quot;launch&quot;. A query string may be
added to the URL of the movie to enable the
&quot;autostart&quot;, &quot;loop&quot; and
&quot;noprogress&quot; properties, if necessary. (E.g., a
link to
&quot;movie.avi?autostart&amp;loop&amp;noprogress&quot; will
add a video that starts playing automatically, loops when it
reaches the end, and does not show the progress bar.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In LaTeX, such
links are created with</p>


<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">\usepackage{hyperref}
<br>
\href{run:&lt;movie file&gt;}{&lt;placeholder
content&gt;}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The movie will
playback in the area taken by the placeholder content. Using
a frame of the movie will ensure the correct aspect
ratio.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>Pointer
Mode</b> <br>
If needed it is possible to turn on a pointer which draws a
red dot in the place pointed by mouse cursor on both -
presenter and presentation screens. It is also possible to
increase and decrease the pointer size. Additionally when
the pointer is enabled it is possible to drag &amp; drop
some area of the presenter screen causing it to be
highlighted in both views as well. Area outside the selected
region will be dimmed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>pdfpc
Files</b> <br>
The notes and other additional information are stored in a
file with the extension &quot;pdfpc&quot;. When pdfpc is
invoked with a PDF file, it automatically checks for and
loads the associated pdfpc file, if it exists. This means
that you normally do not have to deal with this kind of
files explicitly.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are
however cases where you may want to edit the files manually.
The most typical case is if you add or remove some slides
after you have edited notes or defined overlays. It may be
quicker to edit the pdfpc file than to re-enter the whole
information. Future versions may include external tools for
dealing with this case automatically.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The files are
plain-text files that should be fairly self-explanatory. A
couple of things to note:</p>
