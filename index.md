### About

pdfpc is a GTK-based presentation viewer which uses Keynote-like multi-monitor
output to provide meta information to the speaker during the presentation. It
is able to show a normal presentation window on one screen while showing a more
sophisticated overview on the other one, providing information like a picture
of the next slide, as well as the time left in the presentation. pdfpc
processes PDF documents, which can be created using nearly all modern
presentation software.
