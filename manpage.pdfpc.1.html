pdfpc is a GTK-based presentation viewer which uses Keynote-like multi-monitor
  output to provide meta information to the speaker during the presentation. It
  is able to show a normal presentation window on one screen while showing a
  more sophisticated overview on the other one, providing information like a
  picture of the next slide, as well as the time left in the presentation. pdfpc
  processes PDF documents, which can be created using nearly all modern
  presentation software.
<div class="Pp"></div>
By default the presenter view appears in the primary monitor and the
  presentation view in the second monitor (provided you have two monitors).

<div class="Pp"></div>
<h1 class="Sh" title="Sh" id="FEATURES"><a class="permalink" href="#FEATURES">FEATURES</a></h1>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Caching_/_Pre-rendering"><a class="permalink" href="#Caching_/_Pre-rendering">Caching
  / Pre-rendering</a></h2>
To allow fast changes between the different slides of the presentation the PDF
  pages are pre-rendered to memory. The progress bar on the bottom of the
  presenter screen indicates how many percent of the slides have been
  pre-rendered already. During the initial rendering phase this will slow down
  slide changes, as most CPU power is used for the rendering process in the
  background. After the cache is fully primed, however, the changing of slides
  should be much faster, as with normal PDF viewers.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
As the pre-rendering takes a lot of memory it can be disabled using the
  --disable-cache switch at the cost of speed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
It it also possible to store the pre-rendered slides on the disk (see
  --persist-cache). This speeds up the start of the program if the slide set is
  used next time unchanged.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Cache_compression"><a class="permalink" href="#Cache_compression">Cache
  compression</a></h2>
The pre-rendered and cached slides can be compressed in memory to save up some
  memory. Without compression a set of about 100 PDF pages can easily grow up to
  about 1.5 GB size. Netbooks with only 1 GB of memory would swap heavily if
  pre-rendering is enabled in such a situation. The compression is enabled by
  default as it does not harm rendering speed in a noticeable way on most
  systems. It does, however, slow down pre-rendering by about a factor of two.
  If you have got enough memory and want to ensure the fastest possible
  pre-rendering you can disable slide compression by using the -z switch. But be
  warned that using the uncompressed pre-rendering storage will use about 30
  times the memory the new compressed storage utilizes (e.g. 50 MB will become
  about 1.5 GB).
<div class="Pp"></div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Timer"><a class="permalink" href="#Timer">Timer</a></h2>
If a duration is given (-d option), the timer will show a countdown with the
  given parameters. If no duration is specified (or if a value of 0 is given to
  the -d option), the timer will show how much time has been spent. The duration
  is stored automatically, so you do not need to repeat it for every invocation.
<div class="Pp"></div>
The timer is started if you are navigating away from the first page for the
  first time. This feature is quite useful as you may want to show the title
  page of your presentation while people are still entering the room and the
  presentation has not really begun yet. If you want to start over you can use
  the 'r' key which will make the presenter reset the timer.
<div class="Pp"></div>
If a duration is given, the timer also provides hints aiding the presenter to
  judge whether the talk would end on time. There are two modes in which pdfpc
  can operate. In the old (and the only one available up to, and including
  pdfpc-4.0.8) mode, at the moment the timer reaches the defined last-minutes
  value it will change color to indicate your talk is nearing its end, thus
  mimicking a chairman frantically pantomiming in front of you with five (four,
  three, ...) fingers up. A drawback of this approach is it is often too late at
  that moment to alter the presentation pace without ruining to some extent the
  rest of the talk. On the other hand, the warning indication provides an
  unnecessary distraction if you have been perfectly conveying the talk and the
  remaining time is adequate.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Contrary to that, in the new (default) mode, pdfpc tracks your progress
  continuously, calculating the expected time as
  (talk_duration)*(current_user_slide_number -
  0.5)/(total_number_of_user_slides) and comparing it to the actual wall time
  since beginning of the talk. If these two numbers differ by more than 60
  seconds, the timer changes its color to either orange (indicating you need to
  speed up) or a blueish one (need to slow down). Once the optimal progress is
  recovered, the timer becomes white again. In this mode, the last-minutes
  option (-l) has no effect. The previous behavior can be restored by setting
  the 'timer-pace-color' option to 'false' in the configuration file, see
  <b>pdfpcrc(5).</b>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In any case as soon as the timer reaches the zero mark (00:00:00), it will turn
  red and count further down showing a negative time, to provide information on
  how many minutes you are overtime.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Notes"><a class="permalink" href="#Notes">Notes</a></h2>
Textual notes can be displayed for each slide. A few types of PDF annotations
  are understood by pdfpc and will be automatically imported and displayed (only
  their textual content, no formatting attributes are preserved). The PDF
  annotations can be made using many PDF editors and even viewers. These
  &quot;native&quot; PDF notes cannot be edited in pdfpc.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition, while in the presentation mode, pressing 'n' will allow you to take
  notes for the current user slide. To exit the note editing mode, press the
  Escape key. Note that while editing a note, the keybindings stop working, i.e.
  you are not able to change slides. These notes are stored in the .pdfpc file
  in a plain text format, easy to edit also from outside the program; see the
  section about the pdfpc format below. These notes take precedence over the
  native PDF annotations, i.e., if a user-proveded note exists for a given
  slide, any PDF annotations on that page will be silently ignored.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Although mixing the two types of notes is possible, for a given presentation one
  will likely want to have either only the &quot;native&quot; notes (produced by
  the same PDF authoring software used for making the slides), or only the
  &quot;pdfpc&quot; ones.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Overview_mode"><a class="permalink" href="#Overview_mode">Overview
  mode</a></h2>
Pressing the Tab key enters the overview mode, where thumbnails of the slides
  are shown in a grid. You can select a slide to jump to with the mouse or with
  the arrow keys. You can also define overlays and the end slide (see next
  sections) in this mode.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Overlays"><a class="permalink" href="#Overlays">Overlays</a></h2>
Many slide preparation systems allow for overlays, i.e. sets of slides that are
  logically grouped together as a single, changing slide. Examples include
  enumerations where bullet items are displayed one after another, or rough
  &quot;animations&quot;, where parts of a picture change from slide to slide.
  Pdfpc includes facilities for dealing with such overlays.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
In this description, we will differentiate between slides (i.e. pages in the PDF
  document) and &quot;user slides&quot;, that are the logical slides. The
  standard forward movement command (page down, enter, etc.) moves through one
  slide at a time, as expected. This means that every step in the overlay is
  traversed. The backward movement command works differently depending on
  whether the current and previous slides are part of an overlay:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>If the current slide is part of an overlay we just jump to the previous
      slide. That means that we are in the middle of an overlay and can jump
      forward and backward through the single steps of it</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>If the current slide is not part of an overlay (or if it is the first
      one), but the previous slides are, we jump to the previous user slide.
      This means that when going back in the presentation you do not have to go
      through every step of the overlay, pdfpc just shows the first slide of
      each overlay. As one typically goes back in a presentation only when
      looking for a concrete slide, this is more convenient.
    <div class="Pp"></div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The up and down cursor keys work on the &quot;user slide&quot; basis. You can
  use them to skip the rest of an overlay or to jump to the previous user slide,
  ignoring the state of the current slide.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
When going through an overlay, two additional previews may be activated in the
  presenter view, just below the main view, showing the next and the previous
  slide in an overlay.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Pdfpc tries to find these overlays automatically by looking into the page labels
  in the PDF file. For LaTeX this works correctly at least with the beamer class
  and also modifying the page numbers manually (compiling with pdflatex). If
  your preferred slide-producing method does not work correctly with this
  detection, you can supply this information using the 'o' key for each slide
  that is part of an overlay (except the first one!). The page numbering is also
  adapted. This information is automatically stored.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="End_slide"><a class="permalink" href="#End_slide">End
  slide</a></h2>
Some people like to have some additional, backup slides after the last slide in
  the actual presentation. Things like bibliographic references or slides
  referring to specialized questions are typical examples. Pdfpc lets you define
  which is the last slide in the actual presentation via the 'e' key. This just
  changes the progress display in the presenter screen, as to have a better
  overview of how many slides are left.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Movies"><a class="permalink" href="#Movies">Movies</a></h2>
Pdfpc can play back movies included in the PDF file. Movies may be started and
  stopped by clicking within their area. For the presenter, a progress bar is
  drawn along the bottom of the movie. This expands when the mouse hovers over
  it, allowing one to seek by clicking or dragging within the progress bar.
  Switching slides automatically stops playback, and movies will be reset after
  leaving and returning to a slide.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
Movies may be included in PDF files as &quot;screen annotations&quot;. pdfpc
  does not yet support options that modify the playback of these movies. In
  LaTeX, such movies may be added to a presentation with the &quot;movie15&quot;
  or &quot;multimedia&quot; package. Note that the poster, autoplay, and repeat
  options are not yet supported. (Also, run ps2pdf with the -dNOSAFER flag.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
As a perhaps simpler option, pdfpc will play back movies linked from a hyperlink
  of type &quot;launch&quot;. A query string may be added to the URL of the
  movie to enable the &quot;autostart&quot;, &quot;loop&quot; and
  &quot;noprogress&quot; properties, if necessary. (E.g., a link to
  &quot;movie.avi?autostart&amp;loop&amp;noprogress&quot; will add a video that
  starts playing automatically, loops when it reaches the end, and does not show
  the progress bar.)
<div class="Pp"></div>
In LaTeX, such links are created with
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Bd-indent">\usepackage{hyperref}
<div>&#x00A0;</div>
\href{run:&lt;movie file&gt;}{&lt;placeholder content&gt;}</div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The movie will playback in the area taken by the placeholder content. Using a
  frame of the movie will ensure the correct aspect ratio.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>

<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Pointer_mode"><a class="permalink" href="#Pointer_mode">Pointer
  mode</a></h2>
If needed, it is possible to turn on a pointer which draws a red dot in the
  place pointed by mouse cursor on both - presenter and presentation screens. It
  is also possible to increase and decrease the pointer size. Additionally, when
  the pointer is enabled, it is possible to highlight some area of the current
  slide using the drag mouse motion. The area outside the selected region will
  be dimmed.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<h2 class="Ss" title="Ss" id="Drawing_mode"><a class="permalink" href="#Drawing_mode">Drawing
  mode</a></h2>
It is possible to turn on a mode which allows drawing over slides with the mouse
  cursor or a connected tablet. When drawing mode is enabled, drawings can be
  made on the presenter screen. A separate drawing will be kept in memory for
  each slide (based on user slide numbers, so consolidating overlay slides).
  Drawings are presently not saved between sessions.
<div class="Pp"></div>
In the drawing mode, there are two drawing tools, a pen and an eraser. An
  indicator in the bottom-left corner of the presenter screen will indicate
  which is active. When in the pen mode, the color and size of the pen will be
  indicated by the cursor. The pen size can be increased or decreased using hot
  keys specified in the key bindings. When the eraser tool is active, the size

The color of the pen can be changed through key or mouse bindings.

If you are using a tablet, the pen or eraser tool will be selected based on
  whether the tablet reports a pen or eraser input device is being used,
  overriding the normal selection of the drawing tool.

Some additional information is stored in a file with the extension
  &quot;pdfpc&quot;. When pdfpc is invoked with a PDF file, it automatically
  checks for and loads the associated .pdfpc file, if it exists. This means that
  you normally do not have to deal with this kind of files explicitly.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Beside internal configuration, the following command-line options are stored
  within the pdfpc file for later usage:
<div class="Pp"></div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>duration</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>end_time</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>last_minutes</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>notes (position)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>start_time
    <div class="Pp"></div>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Pp"></div>
There are, however, cases where you may want to edit this file manually. The
  most typical case is if you add or remove some slides after you have edited
  notes or defined overlays. It may be quicker to edit the pdfpc file than to
  re-enter the whole information.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
There is also the possibility of including notes from a different file. If pdfpc
  encounters a [notes_include] section with the .pdfpc file it reads the notes
  <b>only</b> from the included file. Changing notes within pdfpc is then
  forbidden.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<div class="Pp"></div>
The files are plain-text files that should be fairly self-explanatory. A couple
  of things to note:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>The slide numbers of the notes refer to user slides</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>Slide indexes start at 1
    <div class="Pp"></div>
  </dd>
</dl>

With GTK3 it is possible to modify the appearance of pdfpc. There are two
  locations where pdfpc is looking for files. The default location is
  @CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/share/pixmaps/pdfpc/pdfpc.css. It can be copied to
  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pdfpc/pdfpc.css and modified to the user's liking.

Pdfpc provides a DBus interface that appears on the session bus as
  <i>io.github.pdfpc</i>. Other applications can, in particular, execute any
  action listed by <b>--list-actions</b>. It is also possible to control pdfpc
  from the command line (and write shell scripts) using the <b>dbus-send</b>(1)
  utility. For example, to advance to the next slide, run
<div class="Pp"></div>
dbus-send --type=method_call --session --dest=io.github.pdfpc
<br/>
 /io/github/pdfpc io.github.pdfpc.TriggerAction string:next
<div class="Pp"></div>
In addition to the <b>TriggerAction</b> method, the pdfpc DBus interface exposes
  the <b>GetNotes</b> method, three properties (<b>NumberOfOverlays</b>,
  <b>NumberOfSlides</b>, <b>Url</b>) and two signals (<b>OverlayChange</b> and
  <b>SlideChange</b>).

The LaTeX package &quot;hyperref&quot; produces buggy results when using with
  beamer notes. It is recommended to use the &quot;multimedia&quot; package
  instead.

There are several other programs with similar functionality.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>impressive</b>(1) has nice transition effects.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>hpdfp</b>(1) is the Haskell PDF Presenter &#x27E8;URL:
  http://michaeldadams.org/projects/haskell-pdf-presenter/ &#x27E9; program,
  which packs an amazing level of functionality into not many lines of Haskell.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>pympress</b>(1) is a little PDF reader written in Python &#x27E8;URL:
  https://github.com/Cimbali/pympress &#x27E9; which handles dual screens and
  beamer notes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
<b>dspdfviewer</b>(1) is also specialized for beamer-produced wide PDF with
  notes.
<div class="Pp"></div>
Many PDF viewers have full-screen presentation modes, but without dual-monitor
  preview or notes or a timer. These include <b>zathura</b>(1),
  <b>evince</b>(1), and <b>okular</b>(1).</div>
